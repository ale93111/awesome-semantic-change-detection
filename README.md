# Dataset

- 2023.[**ChangeNet**](https://github.com/jankyee/ChangNet)      
The ChangeNet dataset comprises 31,000 pairs of multi-temporal images, each with a resolution of 0.3 meters.  It encapsulates a diverse array of complex scenes from 100 different cities.  Additionally, the dataset includes six pixel-level annotated categories, which encompass the classes of "building," "farmland," "bareland," "water," "road," and "unchanged". Paper: [Ji et al., 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17428)

- 2023.[**CNAM-CD**](https://github.com/Silvestezhou/CNAM-CD)   
CNAM-CD is a multi-class change detection dataset that collects images of 12 different urban scenes from the past decade. The dataset selects 12 State-level New Areas in China as the study area and contains 2503 pairs of GeoTiff format images with a pixel size of 512Ã—512. The images were captured at different times from 2013 to 2022. The data source is Google Earth, and the resolution is 0.5m. Paper: [Zhou et al.2023](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/15/9/2464)

- 2020.[**SEmantic Change detectiON Dataset (SECOND)**](https://captain-whu.github.io/SCD/)   
SECOND, a well-annotated semantic change detection dataset, which collects 4662 pairs of aerial images from several platforms and sensors. These pairs of images are distributed over the cities such as Hangzhou, Chengdu, and Shanghai. Each image has size 512 x 512 and is annotated at the pixel level. SECOND focus on 6 main land-cover classes, i.e. , non-vegetated ground surface, tree, low vegetation, water, buildings, and playgrounds, that are frequently involved in natural and man-made geographical changes. Paper: [Yang et al.2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.05687)
